# Aggregate burden estimates over age

This import will take the raw stochastic and central estimates from table `stochastic_1_age_disag` and aggregate over age in 4 different ways and save to a new tables `stochastic_1`, .., `stochastic_4`. It also saves metadata about what this these tables are to table `stochastic_file` This matches the current schema of `stochastic_n` tables in annex.

## Benchmark

```
start <- Sys.time()
dettl::dettl_run("2022-03-16_aggregate_burden_estimate_age", stage = c("extract", "transform", "load"))
end <- Sys.time()
end - start
```
